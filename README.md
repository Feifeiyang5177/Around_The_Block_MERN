## Around the Block

Around the Block is an invite-only app designed for seniors to join social events. 

## Background and Overview 

Have you ever thought about whether your parents or grandparents are still in touch with the world around them? Have you ever worried about if they are happy and healthy when you are not around? According to The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, by the end of 2019, the population of age 65+ in the United States was 54.1 million. What technology can do to help seniors enjoy their social life has become the main goal Around the Block wants to serve. 

As an app designed for seniors to participate in social events, Around the Block needs to:
- Let users create accounts and recommend friends to join the app.  
- Allow users to host events by creating events and providing details such as title, description, location, and time. 
- Allow users to access the events by visualizing the location on a map.
- Allow users to confirm an existing event by texting or voice messaging.
